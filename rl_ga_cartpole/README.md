# Evolving NN RL parameters with Genetic Algorithm (GA)

## Overview

This project explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) to evolve the parameters of a Neural Network (NN) for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. Specifically, it focuses on using a GA to optimize the neural network weights to solve the "CartPole-v1" environment from the OpenAI Gym.

## Environment Setup

Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your Python environment. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
